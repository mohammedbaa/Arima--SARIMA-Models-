# Time Series Analysis: ARIMA and SARIMA Models on Tesla and Airline Data
This project involves the application of various time series analysis techniques to model and forecast data from Tesla stock prices and airline passenger numbers. The project demonstrates the use of ARIMA and SARIMA models for non-seasonal and seasonal data, respectively.

### Key Highlights
##### Data Sources: 
-Yahoo Finance for Tesla stock data
-Public Dataset for airline passenger data
#### Libraries Used
-Pandas
-Pandas DataReader
-NumPy
-yFinance
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Statsmodels

#### Techniques Implemented
-Simple Moving Average
-Cumulative Moving Average
-Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
-ARIMA
-SARIMA

#### Insights
-For non-seasonal data like Tesla stock prices, ARIMA models performed well.
-For seasonal data like airline passenger numbers, SARIMA models were more appropriate.
Visualizations
-Moving averages and EMAs of Tesla stock prices
-ADF tests to check stationarity of airline passenger data
-Differencing techniques to make the time series data stationary Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA models



### Takeaway
-- ARIMA models are effective for stock price prediction, whereas SARIMA models are suitable for seasonal data.
